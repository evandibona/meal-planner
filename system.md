We'll have a master list of ingredients with macros, calories, and prices. Will be consistently updated every month or so. 

Also will have a master list of recipes. Will take the form of separate files in a folder. Meta data on ingedients and portions, then the text of the recipe. 

## Tools

*I need a set of tools for handling the various systems here.*

------------

* list ingredients in recipes which have no data. 
* list ingredients not used in a recipe. 
* list recipes with missing meta-data
