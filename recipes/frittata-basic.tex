\section{Basic Frittata}

\subsection{ Ingredients }

\begin{itemize}
  \item <12> Large Eggs
  \item <3 tbs> Milk, sub coconut cream, yogurt, etc.
  \item <1/2 tbs> Avocado Oil 
  \item <5 cups> Mixed Vegetables, raw
  \item <1 oz> Parmesan Cheese
  \item <1 tsp> Salt, and pepper to taste. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Directions }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To avoid a watery frittata, you need to first sauté your vegetables lightly with a little oil in a 10-inch pan, until softened. If you’re using leftover cooked vegetables, then there’s no need to do this step. Make sure to season the vegetables too – but remember that cheese will be added to the eggs, so you don’t need too much salt.
  \item Combine the eggs, milk, and spices in a large bowl and whisk until combined. Try not to over whisk the eggs.
  \item Spread the vegetables out in the pan and add half the cheese. Then turn off the heat and pour the eggs over the top of the vegetables, finally sprinkling over the remaining cheese.
  \item Bake the frittata for around 20 minutes at 350F/125C, or until the eggs have puffed up in the center and the center is slightly jiggly but cooked through. Then broil the vegetable frittata until golden on top.
\end{enumerate}
