\section{Peppercorn \& Cheese Crusted Steak}

\subsection{ Ingredients }

\begin{itemize}
  \item <20 oz> Filet Mignon, or tri-tip steaks
  \item <2 tbs> Peppercorns, coursely ground
  \item <1/2 tsp> Salt, kosher
  \item <1/4 cup> Butter, unsalted and softened
  \item <1/4 cup> Panko Bread Crumbs
  \item <1/2 tsp> Dried Basil
  \item <2 tbs> Parmesan Cheese
  \item <2> Scallions, white and green parts minced
  \item <1 tbs> Avocado Oil, Ghee, or another oil. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Directions }

\textit{For the steak:} Coat steak in roughly cracked peppercorns and salt. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 

\textit{For the topping:} Thoroughly combine butter, basil, bread crumbs, scallions, and Parmesan. Add salt and pepper to taste. On a sheet of parchment paper, shape scoops of the mixture into four 1/4-inch thick flattened disks that will fit over the entire top of each steak. Leave topping disks on the paper, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 

\textit{To cook:} Preheat broiler and remove the steaks and topping from the refrigerator. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet over high heat. Reduce heat to med-high and add steaks. For a medium-rare to medium steak, sear for 5 to 6 minutes on one side, then flip and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Working quickly, place a disk of topping on each steak and put the skillet under the broiler until topping is nicely browned with some green still showing, about 3 minutes. Immediately transfer steaks to a platter and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
