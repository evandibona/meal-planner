\section{Simple Balsamic Vinaigrette}

\subsection{ Ingredients }

\begin{itemize}
  \item <1/4 cup> Balsamic Vinegar
  \item <1 tsp> Dijon Mustard, optional to taste
  \item <2 clove> Garlic, minced, to taste
  \item <1/2 tsp> Salt
  \item <1/2 tsp> Black Pepper, freshly ground
  \item <3/8 cup> EVOO, give or take to preference
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Directions }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar with salt, pepper, garlic, Dijon until all is dissolved. 
  \item Very slowly start to drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to vigorously whisk.

  \item Use immediately on your favourite salad of mixed greens and enjoy.

  \item Note: Store unused vinaigrette in a screw top jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. (I usually make a double batch to always have some handy, so when I'm in the mood for a salad, I don't have to bother making the dressing). Shake well before each use.
\end{enumerate}
