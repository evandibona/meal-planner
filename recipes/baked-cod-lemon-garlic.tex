\begin{itemize}
  \item 4 (6-ounce) pieces boneless, skinless cod fillets
  \item Sea salt, to taste
  \item Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
  \item 1 1/2 teaspoons unsalted butter 
  \item 1 tablespoon olive oil 
  \item 2 cloves garlic, crushed 
  \item 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
  \item 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Directions }

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Preheat the oven to 400 F. Very lightly coat the bottom of a baking dish large enough to hold the fish in one layer with cooking spray. 
  \item Pat the cod pieces with a paper towel and place them in the baking dish. 
  \item Season the fish with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
  \item Place the butter and olive oil in a small nonstick skillet. Heat on medium-low. Add the garlic and saut√© for 1 minute. Add the lemon juice and parsley, then remove from the heat. 
  \item Drizzle the lemon-garlic mixture over the top of the fish.
  \item Bake uncovered for 12 to 14 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. If desired, serve the accumulated pan juices on the side.
