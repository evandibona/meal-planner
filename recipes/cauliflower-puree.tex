\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 head of cauliflower, broke into florets
  \item 4 tbsp / 50 g butter
  \item 2 shallots, finely sliced
  \item 4 tbsp double cream
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Directions }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Chop the cauliflower florets into small pieces. 
  \item Melt a little butter in a medium saucepan, add the shallots and cauliflower and sweat until soft but not colored. 
  \item Continue to cook to evaporate the liquid and until the cauliflower is cooked. Transfer the shallots and cauliflower to a blender, add cream as required to blend to a smooth puree (add the cream slowly until the cauliflower starts to puree).
