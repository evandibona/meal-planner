We'll have a master list of ingredients with macros, calories, and prices. Will be consistently updated every month or so. 

Also will have a master list of recipes. Will take the form of separate files in a folder. Meta data on ingedients and portions, then the text of the recipe. 

## Tools

*I need a set of tools for handling the various systems here.*

------------

* list ingredients in recipes which have no data. 
* list ingredients not used in a recipe. 
* list recipes with missing meta-data


## Shopping

Veggies often need to be purchased twice a week, whereas grains and frozen meats can be done every couple of weeks, or every month. 

Will need to figure out how to generate this list

## Quantity

May need a separate lookup table for a sprig of thyme, x number of zucchini, egg, carrot, etc.

Might make the most sense to use my discernment in writing the recipe and then using the table to estimate the amount of the ingredient for the final tex file.
